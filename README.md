This is a very basic and bad work in progress programming language based in python

## Documentation
### Functions and if statments:

**print:**
displays that line of code in the console

Example:

input:
```
print() 3 + 2
```
output:
```
5
```

**if:**
checks if a statment is true and if it's false it will skip the next line

Example:

input:
```
if() 2 = 2
print() 3
```

output:
```
3
```

### Counting:

"+" = addition

"-" = subtraktion

"*" = multiplication

"/" = division

"^" = exponents

"'" = radicals

Example:

input:
```
print() 9 ' 2 
```

output:
```
3
```

### Variables:

variables can be any name made up of letters

Example:

input:
```
a = 2 * 2
print() a
```

output:
```
4
```

### Syntax:

The syntax is very loose as you can put almost anything anywhere as long as there are values on both sides of an operator, so can you put you functions and if statments anywhere in the code

Example 1:

input:
```
print() 4
```
output:
```
4
```

Example 2:

input:
```
4 print()
```
output:
```
4
```
So both of these work exactly the same so as long as there are varlues on both sides of operators, it's a very free language syntax vise
